                  Gas Guzzlrs, Inc. (individually and collectively, the
                  “Company”), incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas
                  offers services through an internet-enabled peer-to-peer
                  (“P2P”) marketplace for the purchase and sale of digital
                  assets.

                  Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
                  (“FinCEN”). Shibnobi’s Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) policies
                  and procedures are designed to deter illicit activities on the
                  platform, protect the users, the business, and the digital
                  currencies and financial services communities from
                  exploitation by criminals. The Company is compliant with the
                  requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and related FinCEN
                  regulations and guidance.
                </p>

                  As part of Shibnobi’s Compliance policies, Know Your Customer
                  (“KYC”) policies and procedures for individual and
                  institutional customers have been designed to enable the
                  Company to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true
                  identity of those of its customers for which such review has
                  been performed. The policy applies to all users on the
                  platform and is followed by all of the Company’s employees,
                  consultants, officers, owners and directors.

                <p>
                  Using a risk based approach as part of KYC & AML Compliance,

                    We file SARs if we know, suspect or have reason to suspect
                    suspicious activities have occurred on our platform. A
                    suspicious transaction is often one that is inconsistent
                    with a user’s known and legitimate business, personal
                    activities or personal means. Our Chief Compliance Officer
                    reviews and investigates suspicious activity to determine if
                    sufficient information has been collected to justify the
                    filing of a SAR. Our Chief Compliance Officer maintains
                    records and supporting documentation of all SARs that have
                    been filed.
