This Agreement applies to the extent you use the Digital Services to (a) act as a “Buyer” submitting bids expressing an intent to purchase vehicles or other products and services listed by Sellers on the Digital Services, (b) act as a “Seller” submitting information in connection with the listing of a vehicle or other product or service on a Digital Service by shibnobiMedia on your behalf or (c) as a visitor, registrant or user in any other capacity permitted by these terms (together with “Buyers” and “Sellers”, collectively, “Users”).
