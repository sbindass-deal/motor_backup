                This 2019 McLaren Senna is #197 of 500 examples produced to
                commemorate racing driver Ayrton Senna’s success with the
                McLaren Formula 1 team and was delivered new to McLaren Chicago.
                It was subsequently registered in several states before it was
                purchased by the seller out of Wisconsin in 2022 and imported to
                Canada. The carbon-fiber monocoque body is finished in Graphite
                Grey with Paris Blue aerovanes, and power comes from a
                twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 paired with a seven-speed
                dual-clutch automatic transaxle. Features include the McLaren
                Track Telemetry package, front and rear parking sensors, a
                back-up camera, a glass upper rear bulkhead, black leather
                upholstery, Alcantara-trimmed side sills, and a Bowers & Wilkins
                seven-speaker audio system. Gorilla Glass door panels were
                installed by McLaren Toronto in April 2022. This Senna has 670
                miles and is now offered at no reserve in Canada with a window
                sticker copy, recent service records, removed carbon-fiber door
                panels, a clean Carfax report, and Ontario registration in the
                name of the seller’s company.
