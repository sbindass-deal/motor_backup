    que: "Do I have to be a dealer to attend your auction?",
    ans: `Anyone can attend our online auctions. You do not have to be a dealer to purchase.
       In rare cases, some items are only available for auction to licensed automotive dealers. Those items are noted as "Dealer, Out of State." This note means that you must be a licensed automotive dealer or that you must live out of the state of the auction sale to purchase those items. Generally, those requirements are in place to comply with state or local laws, such as emission regulations. The vast majority of auction inventory is available to anyone who has a valid, government-issued photo ID

    Open titles are created when a seller signs the title over to the party that has purchased the vehicle, but the buyer information is left blank and ownership of the car is not transferred. Open titles are used in schemes referred to as title jumping or title skipping, both of which are illegal. Unknowing sellers and buyers that enter into transactions with this type of title may be subjected to a variety of risks, including liability for a vehicle that has already been sold and difficulties in transferring ownership after making a purchase.
